Welcome to **Shmaplex** – where passion for creativity, craftsmanship, and technology converge.  

We started our journey as a **fingerboard brand**, handcrafting premium fingerboards and offering an online shop for enthusiasts worldwide at [shmaplex.com](https://www.shmaplex.com). Our love for design, precision, and culture drove us to grow beyond products, embracing **technology as a global platform for innovation**.  

Today, Shmaplex is also a **technology company**, building apps and tools that make a difference. One of our key projects is **[Nous](https://github.com/shmaplex/nous)**, and we continue to explore new applications, software, and experiences that combine creativity with utility.
